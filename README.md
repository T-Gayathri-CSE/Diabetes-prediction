ðŸ©º Diabetes Prediction Using Machine Learning Techniques

## Overview

This project aims to predict the likelihood of diabetes in patients using various machine learning techniques. 
By leveraging algorithms such as Support Vector Machine, Naive Bayes, and Random Forest, the system can provide accurate predictions and assist in early diagnosis and treatment planning.

## Project Description

### Techniques Used

- Support Vector Machine (SVM): A supervised learning algorithm that can classify cases by finding a decision boundary.
- Naive Bayes (NB): A probabilistic classifier based on Bayes' theorem with strong independence assumptions between the features.
- Random Forest (RF): An ensemble learning method that operates by constructing multiple decision trees during training and outputting the mode of the classes.
 
### Features

- Prediction Accuracy: Compares the accuracy of different machine learning algorithms.
- User-Friendly Interface: Provides an intuitive interface for users to input data and get predictions.
- Result Display: Shows positive or negative results based on the prediction model.
